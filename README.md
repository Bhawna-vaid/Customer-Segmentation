# Customer Segmentation and Purchase Prediction

## ðŸ“– Project Overview
This project focuses on analyzing customer behavior from transaction data to identify different customer segments and predict future purchases. The goal is to help businesses understand their customers better and tailor marketing strategies to improve customer engagement, retention, and profitability.

## ðŸŽ¯ Objectives
1. **Data Cleaning**  
   Prepare and clean customer transaction data by handling missing values, removing duplicates, and transforming variables for analysis.

2. **Feature Engineering**  
   Create new features such as:
   - **Customer Lifetime Value (CLV):** Total spending per customer.
   - **Average Order Value (AOV):** Spending per transaction.
   - **Frequency:** Number of transactions per customer.

3. **Customer Segmentation**  
   Apply clustering techniques like **K-Means** to group customers into segments such as high-value, moderate, and low-value customers.

4. **Modeling**  
   Build predictive models like **Decision Tree Regressor** to forecast future customer purchases based on historical behavior.

5. **Insights & Recommendations**  
   Provide actionable strategies for marketing campaigns based on the segmentation results.
